Author: Jorge Ortiz, Rutgers University

This repository contains a number of examples for topics covered in the CPS-ML graduate course at Rutgers University.

Main topics:
 * domain-adaptation
 * gans
 * active-learning
 * bayesian-methods
 * deep-learning

Domain adaptation example are based on theory of domain adaptation techniques:
1) covariate shift with shared support
2) covariate shift without shared support
